## Hi there 👋

I'm Jason, a Data Science student at Simon Fraser University.

I build practical machine learning projects and clean analytics workflows.

If there's a dataset, chances are I’ll explore it, model it, and try to improve it.

My main stack is Python, NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.  
I focus on model evaluation, feature engineering, and building end-to-end ML systems.

I’m currently building and refining real-world ML projects.
